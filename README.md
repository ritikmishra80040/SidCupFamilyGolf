# SidCupFamilyGolf
Project Description
This project is a clone of the popular website Sidcup Family Golf.
The purpose of this project is to recreate the core features and design elements of the original website while customizing it to suit our specific needs and learning objectives.
By creating this clone website, we aim to improve our web development skills, understand the technologies used in building the original website, and showcase our abilities in creating responsive and visually appealing web applications.
